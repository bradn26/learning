# I think that 'if' is something that takes on the action of the code below it

# 'if' function IF the condition is true, do the indented function. I think this has
# to do with styling & making it easier to see the functions and what they do?

# not indenting leads to an indent error, for whatever reason.

# changing the variables changes the outputs of the 'if-statement'
